    <h2> About Me <img class="image2" src="caden.jpg" alt="." style="padding-right:0px;"> </h2>
    <p> What is there to know? I can assure you there isn't a whole lot here. I am a pretty simple college student who enjoys coding and playing video games. Before COVID-19, I also loved going to the local soccer complexes and staying in good shape.
      This last year has been pretty turbulent for myself along with many others. It poses many unique challenges that you can either learn from or give up. 2020 has been all about learning and adapting to new work situations so I am proud to have
      achieved what I have at OTC in the CIS program this semester and I am excited to continue on until I get my assosciates degree. I will be graduating in 2020 and am acitvely searching for internships.</p>

    <h2> Classes at OTC and Programming Experience <img class="image1" src="cis.jpg" alt="."></h2>

    <ul>
      <li> Intro to Communications (COM-100) </li>
      <li> Web Development I (CIS-130) </li>
      <li> Intro to Computer Programming (CIS 120) </li>
      <li> Technology and Digital Literacy (CIS-101) </li>
    </ul>
    <p> This has certainly been an interesting year of schooling for me, being apart of the class of 2020 was really just a wilde experience. It made the transition to college kind of difficult, but I learned life is all about how you deal with
      change. I took the challenge and although these turbulent last few months, I have done pretty okay in my classes at OTC. </p>

    <p> I am planning on taking more programming classes next semester and I am looking forward to learning more to make myself a better programmer. Considering I had no prior coding experience, I am proud of what I can do now. With my experience in python and javascript/html coding, I am hoping it translates well into C# and I can really get to work.</p>
